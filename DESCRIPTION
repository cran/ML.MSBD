Description: Inference of a multi-states birth-death model from a phylogeny, comprising a number of states N, birth and death rates for each state and on which edges each state appears. Inference is done using a hybrid approach: states are progressively added in a greedy approach. For a fixed number of states N the best model is selected via maximum likelihood. Reference: J. Barido-Sottani, T. G. Vaughan and T. Stadler (2018) <doi:10.1098/rsif.2018.0512>.
